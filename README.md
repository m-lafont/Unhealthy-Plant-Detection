# Unhealthy-Plant-Detection

Overview

The Unhealthy Plant Detection project was developed as part of the Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning (AN2DL) course for the 2023-2024 academic year. The goal was to create a binary classification model to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy plants based on image data.

This project utilizes a fine-tuned EfficientNet B0 model with extensive preprocessing and data augmentation techniques to achieve high classification accuracy. The work was conducted by a team of students leveraging transfer learning, advanced preprocessing, and optimization strategies.
